# üöÄ Applied Data Science Capstone

This repository contains the final capstone project for the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). It consolidates all the skills and concepts learned throughout the specialization into a practical, real-world application.

## üìÑ Project Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized commercial space travel by significantly reducing the cost of rocket launches. With a launch cost of $62 million for the Falcon 9 compared to competitors charging upwards of $165 million, much of the savings come from reusing the first stage of the rocket. 

This project focuses on predicting whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 launch will successfully land, using publicly available data and machine learning techniques. Accurate predictions could help estimate launch costs and provide valuable insights into the factors influencing successful landings.

## üìä Key Questions

1. How do variables like payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit type impact the success of a first stage landing?
2. Has the rate of successful landings improved over time?
3. Which machine learning algorithm is most effective for binary classification in this scenario?

  - SpaceX's REST API
  - Web scraping from Wikipedia

### 2. Data Preparation
- Filtering and cleaning the dataset
- Addressing missing values
- Applying One-Hot Encoding to prepare features for binary classification

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted an in-depth analysis using SQL and visualizations.

### 4. Interactive Visualization
- Developed visual analytics using tools such as:
  - **Folium** for geospatial data
  - **Plotly Dash** for interactive dashboards

### 5. Predictive Analysis
- Built and fine-tuned classification models to predict first stage landing success.
- Evaluated model performance to determine the most effective algorithm for binary classification.
